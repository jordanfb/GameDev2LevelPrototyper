  _codeName: Mustang
  _bio: "Gender: Female\r\n\r\nAge: mid-20s\r\n\r\nBackground: The Mustang grew up
    on a ranch in Missouri, where she developed a love for all things fast. She raced
    on horseback whenever she could - going up against local boys, rivers, wild animals,
    anything. As she grew older, even the fastest racehorses couldn\u2019t scratch
    the itch, so she turned her love to fast cars and learned to fix up broken vehicles
    to save money. When a fire destroyed her family\u2019s ranch, she decided to head
    east to the big city, searching for a job working with cars. She found one with
    the Family, who needed a getaway driver that wasn\u2019t afraid to get dirty and
    do some repairs. It also gave her a surprising amount of free time to read, which
    was a pastime she always found relaxing. She applied her reckless abandon and
    talents from making repairs on the ranch to find a niche in the Family, and sends
    money home to her parents out west so they can repair and build up the ranch.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career:
    Mechanic, getaway driver\r\n\r\nMotivations: On the surface, she just needs money
    for the newest, fastest cars. But she also needs money to send home to her family
    ranch. \r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public Perception: She\u2019s a bit louder than
    people generally like dealing with, but she\u2019s trustworthy. "
