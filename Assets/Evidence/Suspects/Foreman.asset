  _codeName: The Foreman
  _bio: "Gender: Male\r\n \r\nAge: mid 40s\r\n\r\nBackground: The classic case of
    being in the right place at the right time, Tulley was born and raised in New
    Mexico. He didn\u2019t have much to his name but inherited a sizeable piece of
    property from his deceased grandfather in the northwestern part of state, deep
    in the Navajo nation. Taking residence at a homestead near Church Rock, NM, he
    lived a simple life. One day, he was approached by federal employees with an offer
    from the government for his land. Refusing the large sum at first (exclusively
    due to his strong ancestral ties to the land), he eventually did some digging...literally.
    He had discovered his land sat on a large vein of uranium. As he extracted and
    sold more and more to the federal government, he began to hire others to do the
    digging for him. Soon enough, the land was transformed into a full-scale uranium
    mine, with Tulley collecting most of the profits. He still felt guilty about transforming
    the land of his people into a mine for profits and ended up getting involved with
    the Family when they offered him private land for his family and people (in addition
    to money) in exchange for exclusivity to his uranium.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career:
    Foreman of the Kee Mine, Uranium supplier for The Family\r\n\r\nMotivations: While
    money is a factor, he\u2019s driven by guilt and tradition. He wants to ensure
    his people live on and sees The Family as a potential way to do that.\r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public
    Perception: Tulley\u2019s a humble man for the most part, and his family means
    the world to him. He can, however, develop a bit of a temper if anybody messes
    with his property."
