  _bio: "Gender: Male\r\n\r\nAge: late 60s\r\n\r\nBackground: Born into moderate wealth.
    He took over the family\u2019s textile business after the death of his father
    and grew it to far larger proportions, making him a very wealthy man. A speculative
    man, in the mid-1920s he liquidated his position for a tidy sum. After the market
    crash and the depression hit, he began buying smaller businesses and movie studios
    which ballooned his wealth even further. He\u2019s always prided himself on making
    more money, and funnels funds into multiple projects that he feels can make him
    money, even starting a few things himself. He\u2019s a fan of fine food and drink,
    often looking for ways to spice up meals to impress any guests he may have.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career:
    Currently, he\u2019s an investor and executive for multiple movie studios. He\u2019s
    also bought back a controlling share of his family\u2019s textile business.\r\n\r\nMotivations:
    Money. Everything comes down to money, regardless of what he has to do to get
    it.\r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public Perception: A bit of a recluse. While the
    public knows his name, and his businesses, they rarely see his face. Whenever
    he does make a public appearance, it\u2019s with a convincing smile and an unmistakable
    look.\r\n\n"
