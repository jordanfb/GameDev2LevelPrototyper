  _bio: "Gender: Female\r\n \r\nAge: mid-30s\n\r\nBackground: She was never more than
    just another pretty face in the crowd. She grew up the same way as everybody else.
    She went to school, struggled through the depression with her already pauper parents,
    and eventually found herself moving from her small midwestern homestead to the
    big city in hopes of making something of her life. But the big move only seemed
    to bring with it stress and a smoking habit. Eventually, she landed a gig as a
    simple secretary for a high profile client. While it was menial at first, eventually
    it became her job to keep track of all the boss\u2019 dealings, legal or otherwise.
    She became a master at keeping and\\compiling information, and with this, was
    always one step ahead of trouble. That little taste of power has since left her
    wanting more, and she had a knack at digging up any incriminating information
    on anyone who stood in her way. Always uses her recent paycheck to buy herself
    some fancy, personalized things in hopes of keeping her illusion up.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career:
    Secretary for Thomas Carter\r\n\r\nMotivations: She\u2019s entirely motivated
    by her dream to make it big, and if that means she has to bring down the people
    on the top through blackmail, so be it. Wants her name to be known.\r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public
    Perception: Smoker, but other than that she blends into any crowd with ease. The
    people only see her as a simple secretary (if they even know who she is), not
    realizing how dangerous she can be. \n\n"
