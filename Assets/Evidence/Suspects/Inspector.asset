  _codeName: The Inspector
  _bio: "Gender: Male\r\n\r\nAge: late 30s\r\n\r\nBackground: Thomas was always a
    hard worker, even if he was just another cog in the bureaucratic machine. He took
    pride in his work, and always pushed himself to perform to the best of his ability.
    This was an artifact of his upbringing, as his father was a rather intense individual.
    Though his parents pushed him, they\u2019ve always been the most important people
    in his life. Today, he works as an inspector for the BIR, and travels to different
    sites to ensure things are up to code. He has however, become intertwined with
    the Family and tends to overlook a lot of what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not
    that he wants to be helping them, but the money is good and he seems to fear for
    his life. Maybe it\u2019s just a ruse. He also has had a history with alcohol
    dependence and this illicit business hasn\u2019t helped his hunt for sobriety.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career:
    Agent in the Bureau of Internal Revenue who uses his position to help the government
    stay off the back of the Family.\r\n\r\nMotivations: To get himself to a position
    where he doesn\u2019t rely on alcohol, and to ultimately live up to the visions
    his parents have of him.\r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public Perception: To the everyman,
    seems pretty unassuming. However, anyone who\u2019s talked to him knows that he\u2019s
    incredibly smart. While he doesn\u2019t like to brag, he always insists that he\u2019s
    right."
