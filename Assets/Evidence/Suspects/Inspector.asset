  _bio: "Gender: Male\r\n\r\nAge: late 30s\r\n\r\nBackground: His parents always said
    that from the moment he was born he had a dream to help people. Perhaps that would
    have manifested itself better if they\u2019d shown him the attention that any
    child required. Their careers kept them \u201Ctoo busy\u201D to raise Thomas the
    way they should\u2019ve, so his care fell mostly to his nannies and tutors. However,
    in spite of all this, Thomas learned to become a fairly self-sufficeint child.
    He had a way with both words and numbers, and these talents served him well as
    he grew. Thomas was praised by his teachers (and eventually parents) for being
    \u201Cso smart\u201D and \u201Ca genius.\u201D This eventually went to Thomas\u2019
    head, and without him realizing it he began to \u201Chelp\u201D people through
    the methods he thought was best for them. When he eventually landed himself a
    supervisory position at the US Bureau of Internal Revenue, this practice didn\u2019t
    cease. He used his position to conduct deals to enrich both his own bank account
    and that of those close to him. This wasn\u2019t for the purpose of the money
    itself, however, as his mind was firmly placed in \u201Chelping\u2019 others through
    shady means even if they don\u2019t realize it.\r\n\r\nThomas was always a hard
    worker, even if he was just another cog in the bureaucratic machine. He took pride
    in his work, and always pushed himself to perform to the best of his ability.
    This was an artifact of his upbringing, as his father was a rather intense individual.
    Today, he works as chief inspector for the BIR, and travels to different sites
    to ensure things are up to code. He has however, become intertwined with the Family
    and tends to overlook a lot of what they\u2019re doing.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career:
    Agent in the Bureau of Internal Revenue who uses his position to help the government
    stay off the back of the Family.\r\n\r\nMotivations: \r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public
    Perception:\r\n"
