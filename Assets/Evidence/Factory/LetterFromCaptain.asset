  _flavorText: "\"A letter from my old captain. He's keeping the police off their
    backs. Damn shame he sold out to this operation.\"\n\nBoss,\r\n\r\nThe incident
    with Graves out at your testing site has been taken care of. We\u2019ve addressed
    his death as the death of a hero caught in the line of duty, but have scrubbed
    all findings of your work from the case files, leaving the public and the government
    none the wiser. The positive press for my officers has helped to keep any suspicion
    off of our backs.\r\n\r\nThere is still one problem. Graves\u2019 old partner,
    Detective Marvin Mitchell, has picked up some of the threads of the work that
    Graves left behind. I\u2019ve talked to him about dropping the case, and he agreed
    to do so professionally, but I suspect he may still be looking into your affairs
    on his own time.\r\n\r\nHe lives at 201 Corner Street, Apartment 303. It\u2019d
    be a real shame to lose him if the grief of losing his partner became too much,
    and he did something stupid.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nChief Clapton\r\n"
