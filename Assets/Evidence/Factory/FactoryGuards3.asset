    you gotten to the cinema recently? Been meaning to see that new Brackenridge film.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    one about the corrupt politician? It\u2019s a bit on the nose for me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWell
    the man signed off on it himself, it can\u2019t be too telling. Besides, he\u2019s
    no politician.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CStill, I\u2019d rather to not know anything
    at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m with him on this one. Seems a little risky to
    make a movie so close to reality. But I gotta hand it to him, he\u2019s got guts."
