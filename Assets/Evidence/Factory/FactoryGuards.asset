  _flavorText: "Heard some guards at the factory discussing their recent inspection:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CPassed
    another inspection.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CHeh, well that\u2019s easy when the
    inspector is on your side.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t say? Hey, how
    about that woman that was with him? You ever seen her before?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s
    been with him a few times before. A secretary or something.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CReally?
    Damn, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s pretty clued into the Family\u2019s plans if they
    trust her enough to see everything we\u2019re doing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    want my opinion? She\u2019s dangerous. I think she\u2019s a lot more involved
    than she lets on. I\u2019d steer clear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nSounds like some of the
    workers are starting to suspect the secretary. About time."
