    TEXT---------\n12th March 1949\r\nJames Tyler\r\nInvestigative Lead\r\nBureau
    of Internal Revenue\r\n142 17th Street\r\nCapitalville, USA\r\n\nDear Mr. Carter,\r\nFor
    the purposes of investigating crimes of tax evasion, collusion, embezzlement,
    you have spent over one year in the field in Center City working undercover at
    the factory (located at the corner of 17th and Garden Street) operated by the
    crime syndicate known colloquially as the \u201CNuclear Family.\u201D\r\n\nThe
    last update received from you arrived over six months ago. In those six months,
    several letters and telegrams have been sent to your last known address in an
    attempt to make contact.\r\n\nFailure to update the Bureau could result in your
    termination and/or criminal charges pressed for hindering an ongoing investigation.
    \r\nThis is your final warning. \r\n\nSincerely,\r\nJames Tyler\r\n\n---------END
