  _flavorText: "Overheard some guards talking in the factory\u2019s loading bay:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    know what I never understood? Why they\u2019ve only got one person bringing in
    shipments. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to give us more to work with?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe.
    But then they\u2019d have to worry about any one of the drivers running their
    mouths.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CI guess that\u2019s true. Easier to keep one person
    quiet than a fleet of truck drivers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWell I don\u2019t
    think they\u2019ve got anything to worry about. From what I understand the driver\u2019s
    way more than just a lackey.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CI do trust myself more than
    anyone else. Maybe that\u2019s their philosophy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CSounds
    about right to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nThey\u2019ve got a point. Their driver is
    quick, efficient, and quiet."
