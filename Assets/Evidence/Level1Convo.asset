  _flavorText: "Overheard some guards talking outside of Marv\u2019s office:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CShame
    he had to go. If he\u2019d just let go of Graves\u2019 pipe dream this wouldn\u2019t
    have happened.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CReal shame. Still, I\u2019d rather go out
    in a hit than the way Graves did.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CYeah. He got a real close
    look at that nuclear explosion. Guess he wanted to see what they were up to, but
    got a lot more than he bargained for. \u201C\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CCooked him real
    good. Ya know, I\u2019ve always wondered what they do out there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve
    heard rumors. Some sorta weapon development. They\u2019re still pumping them out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CShouldn\u2019t
    they have shut down after that explosion?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CNah. The Family\u2019s
    got it in real good with the captain. He\u2019s made sure the way is clear for
    them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nBastards. Marv was just doing what was right, same as me.
    What is this world coming to?"
