    themselves.\"\n\nThis exclusivity agreement (hereby referred to as the \u201CAgreement\u201D)
    is entered into and made on October 3rd, 1947, between Tulley Kee (hereby referred
    to as \u201CSeller\u201D) and Robert Brackenridge (hereby referred to as \u201CBuyer\u201D).
    \r\n\r\nSeller and Buyer have expressed interest in entering into an exclusivity
    agreement in regards to the uranium dug up from Kee Mine, located at 1 Mountain
    Lane, Church Rock, New Mexico (hereby referred to as \u201Cthe Mine\u201D). \r\n\r\nFor
    the interest of both involved parties, and to show receipt and acknowledgment
    of this agreement, both parties agree to:\r\n\r\n1. Exclusivity\r\n\r\nThe period
    of exclusivity will begin on October 3rd, 1947, and conclude ten years from that
    date. During this period, Seller will not sell, promote, or solicit any property
    within the Agreement to any other parties. \r\n\r\nBuyer agrees to purchase property
    listed in the Agreement from Seller alone and no other sellers during the term

    and conditions outlined in the agreement for the entire term. \r\n\r\n2. Items
    for Purchase\r\n\r\nThe property listed below is offered by Seller throughout
    the terms of this agreement:\r\n\r\nUranium Ore\r\n\r\nShould any unlisted property

    market, so long as doing so does not breach other terms of the Agreement.\r\n\r\n3.
    Cost to Resell\r\n\r\nSeller reserves the right to enforce and maintain set manufacturer\u2019s
    recommended sale prices (MSRP) for all goods and property listed above. Buyer

    by unserialized United States tender. \r\n\r\nIf the payment is not received by
    the due date, Seller reserves the right to apply a 10% late fee to the invoice
    total. \r\n\r\nFailure to pay constitutes a breach of contract. Seller reserves
    the right to terminate the exclusivity agreement. If termination occurs, Buyer
    is still responsible for all funds due. Seller also has the right to pursue legal
    action to recoup due fees. \r\n\r\nBoth parties agree to an obligation to uphold

    parties have an appropriate amount of time for resolution of the occurrence prior
    to further action being taken. Buyer ensures that Seller will face no direct legal
    action over the course of the Agreement.\r\n\r\n5. Taxes\r\n\r\nBuyer is responsible
    for paying any and all state, local, and/or federal taxes due for goods listen
    in the Agreement. Taxes will be included in the invoiced amount. \r\n\r\n6. Delivery
