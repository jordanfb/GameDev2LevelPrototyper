  _flavorText: "\"The journalist that published this disappeared two weeks ago. What
    a coincidence.\"\n\n---------FULL TEXT---------\nBy Mary Johnson\r\nAugust 13th,
    1950\r\n\r\nOn the corner of 17th and Garden Street, there\u2019s a factory. Its
    brick walls crumble, slowly falling victim to the vines winding up its walls.
    Built to produce weapons for the first World War, these decrepit walls hide the
    secrets within. \r\n\r\nIn the past year, the crime rate in Center City hasn\u2019t
    increased dramatically - only 3%. However, what has changed is police response
    to major crimes. \r\n\r\nHow much did you hear about the death of Detective Colton
    Graves? Or the explosion that occurred at a nuclear test facility less than a
    hundred miles from Central Downtown? Not much, I wager. These tragedies go unsolved,
    and police refuse to answer questions. Why?\r\n\r\nThe answer lies within an understanding
    of the corruption and greed plaguing the Central City Police Department. And at
    the heart of that corruption and greed: the crime syndicate known only as The
    Nuclear Family. \r\n\r\nA motley crew of unknown leadership, The Family came into
    prominence after the Second Great War. Should rumors be believed, they gained
    much of their wealth from creating and testing small-scale nuclear weapons - a
    miniature Manhattan Project, if you will. Now, they survive as bottomfeeders,
    lurking in plain site of the police they pay off for privacy. In the depths of
    the city, they connive and scheme, continuing their weapons development. Their
    dastardly work benefits only themselves and the Reds. \r\n\r\nThey will stop at
    nothing to get what\u2019s best for the Family. If you never see an article published
    under my name again, you know what happened. \r\n\r\n---------END TEXT---------"
