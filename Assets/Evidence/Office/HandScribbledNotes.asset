    TEXT---------\nStevenson moves his mouth when he reads. Sure sign of stupidity.
    He\u2019ll never be more than a paper-pusher.\r\n\r\nDarrin asked for a raise.

    Claims its the style. I saw him staring at wigs in a shop window.\r\n\r\nTurner\u2019s
    trying to quit smokes. Says they killed his uncle. Bullshit.  \r\n\r\nCarter\u2019s
