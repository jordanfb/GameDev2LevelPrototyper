    they're really up to.\"\n\n---------FULL TEXT---------\nDear Mom and Dad,\r\n\r\nThings
    are going great out here. That new position I was writing you about is progressing
    nicely, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t tell you much more about it, I wish I could.\r\n\r\nStill,
    sometimes I feel a bit uneasy. Sometimes I just want to come home and enjoy that
    simpler life for a while. Maybe I\u2019ll come visit sometime next week. My group
    has a big meeting in a few days, but after we take care of that I should have
    a little bit of time off.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve enclosed some money to help you out
    with any bills back home. Hopefully I\u2019ll see you\u2026\r\n\r\n\r---------END
