Overheard some guards talking outside of Marv’s office:


“Shame he had to go. If he’d just let go of Graves’ pipe dream this wouldn’t have happened.”


“Real shame. Still, I’d rather go out in a hit than the way Graves did.”


“Yeah. He got a real close look at that nuclear explosion. Guess he wanted to see what they were up to, but got a lot more than he bargained for. “


“Cooked him real good. Ya know, I’ve always wondered what they do out there.”


“I’ve heard rumors. Some sorta weapon development. They’re still pumping them out.”


“Shouldn’t they have shut down after that explosion?”


“Nah. The Family’s got it in real good with the captain. He’s made sure the way is clear for them.”


Bastards. Marv was just doing what was right, same as me. What is this world coming to?
