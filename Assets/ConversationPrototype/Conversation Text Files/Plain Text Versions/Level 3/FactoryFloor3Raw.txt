Managed to hear some guards talking in the factory:


“Have you gotten to the cinema recently? Been meaning to see that new Brackenridge film.”


“The one about the corrupt politician? It’s a bit on the nose for me.”


“Well the man signed off on it himself, it can’t be too telling. Besides, he’s no politician.”


“Still, I’d rather to not know anything at all.”


I’m with him on this one. Seems a little risky to make a movie so close to reality. But I gotta hand it to him, he’s got guts.
