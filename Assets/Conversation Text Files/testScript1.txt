#Jordan
Hey <speed=.5><i>Eric!</i></speed>
#endline
// you can finish lines with either #endline or just a # symbol

#Eric
What's up <color=#000fffff>Jordan?</color> I heard you were <size=60><i>magic!</i></size>
#

#Jordan
Lol yeah I'm good at writing conversations
Look how we handle multiple lines

and even spaces!
#

#Jordan
I can say things <speed=0>twice</speed><speed=.5> </speed><speed=0>in</speed><speed=.5> </speed><speed=0>a</speed><speed=.5> </speed><speed=0>row</speed> it's kinda crazy
#

#Eric
Wow I'm pretty proud of your ability <b>to talk</b> like a normal human being
#


// #predelay [float value] means it should say this [float value] seconds after the line before starts being said
#Jordan
#predelay .1
I can say things at the same time as you before you're finished if I wanted to because I'm rude
#
// #postdelay [float value] or simply #delay [float value] lets you set a custom time to wait after the line ends

#Eric
#delay 2
Do we like long pauses?
#

#Jordan
#delay 5
No we don't...
#

// currently I don't have a fade away thing set up but we need that
#Eric
#delay 0

#

#Jordan
#predelay 0

#





// you can comment like this
// these are delays from the end (postdelay, delay) or the beginning (predelay) of the line before this one
// used to add extra spacing for lines
// should eventually be able to set default values for all of these
// we may want to make this adjustable in settings too for text speed/whatever

//#postdelay 50 #delay 50
//#predelay 50
// currently you can't use '<' unless it's part of a tag because of the way I'm parsing things. If that's an
// issue I can change it so you can use it
