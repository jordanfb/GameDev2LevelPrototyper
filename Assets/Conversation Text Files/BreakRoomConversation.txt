#BreakGuard1
Did you happen to see what they were drafting up in the conference room this morning?
#


#BreakGuard2
I didn’t. What sort of crazy shit are they up to this time?
#


#BreakGuard1
Not sure, but they had maps laid out everywhere. 
#


#BreakGuard2
Must’ve been planning new routes to the factory. Gotta shake things up from time to time.
#


#BreakGuard1
Whoever’s got to drive that’s got their hands full. 
#


#BreakGuard2
