Huh, must’ve been my imagination.
Dammit! Bastard got away.
Got away this time.
Better keep my eyes open, might still be skulking around.
Must’ve been nothing.
It feels like I’m going crazy.
Man, I need a break.
Oh I’ll get you next time.
Yeah that’s right! You better run!
Heh, scared him away. Must’ve been my brawny stature and big muscles.
