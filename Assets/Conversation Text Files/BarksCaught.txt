I’ve got you now!
Hey, you’re not supposed to be in here!
Get out of here, you rat!
What are you doing here? Get out!
What? Did you get lost?
Scram!
Get the hell out of here!
Get on then! Get!
Who the hell are you? Get out of here!
Well look what we got here. What’s that saying? Curiosity killed the cat? Out. Now.
