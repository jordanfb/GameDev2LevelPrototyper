Heard some guards at the factory discussing their recent inspection:


“Passed another inspection.”


“Heh, well that’s easy when the inspector is on your side.”


“You don’t say? Hey, how about that woman that was with him? You ever seen her before?”


“She’s been with him a few times before. A secretary or something.”


“Really? Damn, I’m sure she’s pretty clued into the Family’s plans if they trust her enough to see everything we’re doing.”


“You want my opinion? She’s dangerous. I think she’s a lot more involved than she lets on. I’d steer clear.”


Sounds like some of the workers are starting to suspect the secretary. About time.
