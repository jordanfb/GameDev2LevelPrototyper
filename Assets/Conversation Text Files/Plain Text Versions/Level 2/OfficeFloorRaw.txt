Heard two guards talking in the office:


“Got another inspection coming up soon.”


“Don’t worry about it. Let’s just say the inspector is...sympathetic towards our cause.”


“Oh really?”


“Yeah, him and that secretary of his. But you didn’t hear it from me.”


Sounds like they’ve got nothing to worry about.
