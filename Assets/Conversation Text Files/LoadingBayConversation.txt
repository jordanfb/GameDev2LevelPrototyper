#LBGuard1
You know what I never understood? Why they’ve only got one person bringing in shipments. Wouldn’t it be better to give us more to work with?
#


#LBGuard2
Maybe. But then they’d have to worry about any one of the drivers running their mouths.
#


#LBGuard1
I guess that’s true. Easier to keep one person quiet than a fleet of truck drivers.
#


#LBGuard2
Well I don’t think they’ve got anything to worry about. From what I understand the driver’s way more than just a lackey.
#


#LBGuard1
I do trust myself more than anyone else. Maybe that’s their philosophy.
#


#LBGuard2
Sounds about right to me.
